## b) Moregenerally,willE[Xk]exist?(k=1,2,3,...). c) Show that 𝜃 is the median of the distribution.

# 4.32: Let X1,X2,...,X10 ∼ Pois(3). Let X = i=1 Xi. Find the pdf for the sampling distribution of X.



# 5.2:  Consider the samples 1, 3, 4, and 6 from some distribution.

## a) For one random bootstrap sample, find the probability that the mean is 1.

## b) For one random bootstrap sample, find the probability that the maximum is 6.

## c) For one random bootstrap sample, find the probability that exactly two elements in the sample are less than 2.

# 6.4: Let X1, X2, ... , Xn be a random sample from the distribution with pdf f (x; 𝜃) = (x3e−x∕𝜃)∕(6𝜃4) for x ≥ 0. Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of 𝜃.

# 6.12: Let X1, X2 be random sample from N(𝜇, 32) and Y1, Y2 be a random sample from N(2𝜇,32), and assume the X′s are independent of the Y′s. ij SupposeX1 =3,X2 =−1,Y1 =3,Y2 =2.Find the MLE of𝜇.

## a) List all the (ordered) bootstrap samples from this sample. How many are there?

## b) How many unordered bootstrap samples are there? For example, {1, 2, 2} and {2, 1, 2} are considered to be the same.

## c) How many ordered bootstrap samples have one occurrence of 1 and two occurrences of 3? Is this the same number of bootstrap samples that have each of 1, 2, and 3 occurring exactly once?

## d) Is the probability of obtaining a bootstrap sample with one 1 and two 3’s the same as the probability of obtaining a bootstrap sample with each of 1, 2, and 3 occurring exactly once?

# 5.B: Consider a population that has a normal distribution with mean 𝜇 = 36, standard deviation 𝜎 = 8

## a) The sampling distribution of X for samples of size 200 will have what mean, standard error, and shape

## b) Use R to draw a random sample of size 200 from this population. Conduct EDA on your sample

## c) Compute the bootstrap distribution for your sample, and note the bootstrap mean and standard error.

## d) Compare the bootstrap distribution to the theoretical sampling distribution by creating a table like Table 5.2

## e) Repeat for sample sizes of n = 50 and n = 10. Carefully describe your observations about the effects of sample size on the bootstrap distribution


# 5.9: Consider a population that has a gamma distribution with parameters r = 5, 𝜆 = 1∕4.

## a) Use simulation (with n = 200) to generate an approximate sampling distribution of the mean; plot and describe the distribution.

## b) Now, draw one random sample of size 200 from this population.Create a histogram of your sample, and find the mean and standard deviation

## c) Compute the bootstrap distribution of the mean for your sample, plot it, and note the bootstrap mean and standard error.

## d) Compare the bootstrap distribution to the approximate theoretical sampling distribution by creating a table like Table 5.2.

## e) Repeat (a)–(e) for sample sizes of n = 50 and n = 10. Describe care- fully your observations about the effects of sample size on the bootstrap distribution


# 5.13: The data set FishMercury contains mercury levels (parts per million) for 30 fish caught in lakes in Minnesota.

## a) Create a histogram or boxplot of the data. What do you observe?

## b) Bootstrap the mean, and record the bootstrap standard error and the 95% bootstrap percentile interval.

## c) Remove the outlier and bootstrap the mean of the remaining data. Record the bootstrap standard error and the 95% bootstrap percentile interval.

##d) What effect did removing the outlier have on the bootstrap distribu- tion, in particular, the standard error?
