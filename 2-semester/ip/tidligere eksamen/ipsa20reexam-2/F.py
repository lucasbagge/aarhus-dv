    VOWEL SORTING

    In this problem you are given n words, and are going to sort the
    words by the number of distinct vowels (AEIOUY) in increasing
    order.  Words with the same number of distinct vowels, should be
    sorted alphabetically.

    Input:

      The first line contains a positive integer n, where n <= 100.
      The following n lines each contain a non-empty word only
      containing characters 'A'-'Z', and each word has at most
      25 characters.

    Ouput:

      The input strings sorted in increasing order with respect to
      the number of distinct vowels. Words with an equal number of
      distinct vowels are sorted alphabetically.

    Example:

      Input:  5
              HELLOWORLD
              ABRACADABRA
              AARHUSUNIVERSITY
              HELLO
              OSLO

      Output: ABRACADABRA
              OSLO
              HELLO
              HELLOWORLD
              AARHUSUNIVERSITY

      In the example 'ABRACADABRA' and 'OSLO' only contain one
      distinct vowel, 'A' and 'O', respectively.  'HELLO' and
      'HELLOWORLD' both contain the two vowels 'O' and 'E', and
      finally 'AARHUSUNIVERSITY' contains the five vowels 'A', 'E',
      'I', 'U' and 'Y'.
