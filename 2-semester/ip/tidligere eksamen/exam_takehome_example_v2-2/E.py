'''INTEGER LIST

   Read a single line of space separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n.
   Output a line with the three integers min, median and max of the list.
   We let the median of a list with n numbers be y_i, where i = ceil(n / 2)
   and y_1, y_2, ..., y_n is x_1, x_2, ..., x_n in sorted order.
   
   Input:

      One line of n space separated integeres x_1 x_2 ... x_n,
      where 1 <= n <= 100 and -1000 <= x_i <= 1000.

   Output:

      A single line with the three integers
        min(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
        max(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
        median(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
      in sorted order.

   Example (see tests/E/... for more examples):

     Input:   49 55 -23 84 -49 100

     Output:  -49 49 100
