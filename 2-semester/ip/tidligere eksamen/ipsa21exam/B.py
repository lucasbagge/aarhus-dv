    SIGN

    Your task is to print the sign of each integer in a list.

    Input:  A Python list of integers L.

    Output: For each integer in L print x, followed by "is" and the sign,
            where sign is either "zero", "negative" or "positive".

    Example:

       Input:  [2, 1, -3, 0, -4, 42]

       Output: 2 is positive
               1 is positive
               -3 is negative
               0 is zero
               -4 is negative
               42 is positive

    Note: The below code already reads the list L from input.
'''


L = eval(input())

# insert code

pass
for i in L:

    if i == 0:

        print(f'{i} is zero')

    if i > 0:

        print(f'{i} is positive')

    if i < 0:

        print(f'{i} is negative')
